Revision history for Perl module Proc::Daemon.

0.05  Thu Okt 28 2010
	- fixed a problem when using the old method of calling Proc::Daemon::Init
      without object (reported by Alex Samorukov). The parent process didn't
      exit.
	- fixed a problem with Proc::ProcessTable 0.44: Under some conditions
      'cmndline' retruns with space and/or other characters at the end.
	- Update and small fixes in the documentation.

0.04  Sun Okt 24 2010
	- Added functions: new(), adjust_settings(), fix_filename(), Status(),
	  Kill_Daemon(), get_pid() and get_pid_by_proc_table_attr().
	- Init() now returns the PID of the daemon.
	- Fork() now allways returns values like Perls built-in 'fork' does.
	- Description was rewritten, extended and moved to the new Daemon.pod file.
	- Additional test are done at installation.
	- $SIG{'HUP'} was set to be valid only 'local' (bug report).
	- POSIX::EAGAIN() was added to Fork() (bug report).

	- Updated author contact information.

0.02  Sat Apr 17 1999
	- init() function superceded by Init() function.
	- All open files are closed during daemonization.
	- A double fork is now down to avoid the potential of acquiring
	  a controlling terminal.
	- Added Fork() and OpenMax() functions.
